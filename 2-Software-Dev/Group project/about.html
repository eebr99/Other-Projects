                  <h1>Our mission </h1>
                    <p class = "text">Thousands of years ago our ancestors scoured the land, often walking for miles on end to find even the smallest bit of food. Cultures formed around the kinds of foods available and the ways to best prepare them within a geographical distance. Today distance is meaningless. Food that was grown in one place can be shipped all around the globe. We are witnessing a great cultural explosion centered on the sharing of our food with all parts of the world.</p>
                  <p class = "text">You can take part in this great food revolution by ordering our extra fancy dishes to be delivered, directly to your home,"COMMING SOON", or served to you at our lavish allyway tables. We have available flavor experiences from all parts of the modern world for you to try. It's our mission to share great cooking with all of humanity, and through our shared culinary experiences, reach world peace.</p>
